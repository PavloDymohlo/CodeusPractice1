This project provides a simple Movie Management System where movies can be managed using
a Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. 
The goal of this warm-up task is to practice fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, collections, and streams in Java.  
  
You will work with two classes:  
    1. Movie  - represents a single movie with a title and a year.  
    2. MovieDao  - provides operations to manage movies, such as registering, retrieving, and filtering movies.  
    
Your task is to implement these classes.
